NeoRouter API in Go
===================

http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category within the "popular and

This code presently allows for interaction with the NeoRouter Linux
client.  It can be expanded (by you, if you'd like; I'd love to
receive patches) to do more things.  Currently all it does is return
a list of computers on your domain.


1) Install this by using:

    goinstall github.com/dustywilson/go-neorouter


2) Code something like this:

    import (
      "os"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/dustywilson/go-neorouter"
    )
    
    func main() {
      list, err := neorouter.GetList("yournrdomain", "user", "pass")
      if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Some error occurred: %s\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
       }
       for i := range list.Computers {
         computer := list.Computers[i]
         online := "OFFLINE"
         if computer.IsOnline {
           online = computer.Ip
          }
          fmt.Printf("Group:\t%s\nName:\t%s\nStatus:\t%s\n\n",
            computer.Group, computer.Name, online)
        }
      }
    }
