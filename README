NeoRouter API in Go
===================

This code presently allows for interaction with the NeoRouter Linux client.

It can be expanded (by you, if you'd like) to do more things.  Currently
all it does it return a list of computers on your domain.


1) Install this by using:

    goinstall github.com/dustywilson/go-neorouter


2) Code something like this:

    import (
      "os"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/dustywilson/go-neorouter"
    )
    
    func main() {
      list, err := neorouter.GetList("neorouterdomain", "username", "password")
      if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Some error occurred: %s\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
       }
       for i := range list.Computers {
         computer := list.Computers[i]
         online := "OFFLINE"
         if computer.IsOnline {
           online = "ONLINE"
          }
          fmt.Printf("Group:\t%s\nName:\t%s\nIP:\t%s\nOnline:\t%s\n\n", computer.Group, computer.Name, computer.Ip, online)
        }
      }
    }
